# reactant

Generate code for *models, views, and urls* based on Python type annotations. Powered by [pydantic](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/). Influenced by [SQLModel](https://github.com/tiangolo/sqlmodel).

*reactant* aims to be non-intrusive and disposable as possible, but also to give usable and sensible code defaults.
